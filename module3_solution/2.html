                    Beef
                    </h3>

                    Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle.
                        Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source 
                        of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2]

                        Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, 
                        such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak,
                         rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky).
                          Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner
                           (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is 
                           used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other
                            muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands
                             (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain
                              (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE,
                               commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull 
                               (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some 
                               intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural 
                               sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

                        Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics,
                         the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, 
                         because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground
                          beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free 
                          on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding 
                          operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are
                           usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.<br><br>

                    <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), 
                    usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), 
                    such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its
                     presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also
                      referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

                    Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice,
                     though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
                     It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail,
                      salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.
                       It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. 
                       Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

                    Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in 
                    Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
